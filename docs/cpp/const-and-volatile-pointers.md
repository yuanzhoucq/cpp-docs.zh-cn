# <a name="const-and-volatile-pointers"></a>固定和可变指针

The [const](const-cpp.md) and [volatile](volatile-cpp.md) keywords change how pointers are treated. The **const** keyword specifies that the pointer cannot be modified after initialization; the pointer is protected from modification thereafter.

The **volatile** keyword specifies that the value associated with the name that follows can be modified by actions other than those in the user application. Therefore, the **volatile** keyword is useful for declaring objects in shared memory that can be accessed by multiple processes or global data areas used for communication with interrupt service routines.

When a name is declared as **volatile**, the compiler reloads the value from memory each time it is accessed by the program. 这将显著减少可能的优化。 但是，当对象的状态可能意外更改时，这是保证可预见的程序性能的唯一方法。

To declare the object pointed to by the pointer as **const** or **volatile**, use a declaration of the form:

```cpp
const char *cpch;
volatile char *vpch;
```

To declare the value of the pointer — that is, the actual address stored in the pointer — as **const** or **volatile**, use a declaration of the form:

```cpp
char * const pchc;
char * volatile pchv;
```

The C++ language prevents assignments that would allow modification of an object or pointer declared as **const**. 此类赋值会移除用来声明对象或指针的信息，从而违反原始声明的意图。 请考虑以下声明：

```cpp
const char cch = 'A';
char ch = 'B';
```

Given the preceding declarations of two objects (`cch`, of type **const char**, and `ch`, of type **char)** , the following declaration/initializations are valid:

```cpp
const char *pch1 = &cch;
const char *const pch4 = &cch;
const char *pch5 = &ch;
char *pch6 = &ch;
char *const pch7 = &ch;
const char *const pch8 = &ch;
```

以下声明/初始化存在错误。

```cpp
char *pch2 = &cch;   // Error
char *const pch3 = &cch;   // Error
```

`pch2` 的声明声明了一个可以用来修改常量对象的指针，因此不允许使用。 The declaration of `pch3` specifies that the pointer is constant, not the object; the declaration is disallowed for the same reason the `pch2` declaration is disallowed.

以下八个赋值显示了通过指针进行的赋值以及对前面的声明的指针值的更改；现在，假设 `pch1` 到 `pch8` 的初始化是正确的。

```cpp
*pch1 = 'A';  // Error: object declared const
pch1 = &ch;   // OK: pointer not declared const
*pch2 = 'A';  // OK: normal pointer
pch2 = &ch;   // OK: normal pointer
*pch3 = 'A';  // OK: object not declared const
pch3 = &ch;   // Error: pointer declared const
*pch4 = 'A';  // Error: object declared const
pch4 = &ch;   // Error: pointer declared const
```

Pointers declared as **volatile**, or as a mixture of **const** and **volatile**, obey the same rules.

Pointers to **const** objects are often used in function declarations as follows:

```cpp
errno_t strcpy_s( char *strDestination, size_t numberOfElements, const char *strSource );
```

The preceding statement declares a function, [strcpy_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/strcpy-s-wcscpy-s-mbscpy-s.md), where two of the three arguments are of type pointer to **char**. Because the arguments are passed by reference and not by value, the function would be free to modify both `strDestination` and `strSource` if `strSource` were not declared as **const**. The declaration of `strSource` as **const** assures the caller that `strSource` cannot be changed by the called function.

> [!NOTE]
> Because there is a standard conversion from *typename* <strong>\*</strong> to **const** *typename* <strong>\*</strong>, it is legal to pass an argument of type `char *` to [strcpy_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/strcpy-s-wcscpy-s-mbscpy-s.md). However, the reverse is not true; no implicit conversion exists to remove the **const** attribute from an object or pointer.

A **const** pointer of a given type can be assigned to a pointer of the same type. However, a pointer that is not **const** cannot be assigned to a **const** pointer. 以下代码显示了正确和错误的赋值：

```cpp
// const_pointer.cpp
int *const cpObject = 0;
int *pObject;

int main() {
pObject = cpObject;
cpObject = pObject;   // C3892
}
```

以下示例显示了当有指针指向某个指向对象的指针时如何将对象声明为 const。

```cpp
// const_pointer2.cpp
struct X {
   X(int i) : m_i(i) { }
   int m_i;
};

int main() {
   // correct
   const X cx(10);
   const X * pcx = &cx;
   const X ** ppcx = &pcx;

   // also correct
   X const cx2(20);
   X const * pcx2 = &cx2;
   X const ** ppcx2 = &pcx2;
}
```
